Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,User Language,"Welcome to the UKRN Survey on Open and Transparent Research Practices


This survey is open to those based at a UK HE institution which has a UKRN Institutional Lead. Its purpose is to establish what the level and perception of Open and Transparent Research Practices are at these institutions. The results of this survey will be used to provide insight into the open research practices that are used and recognised/rewarded across disciplines and institutions. The results will also help identify training gaps. We are interested in gathering responses about both Quantitative AND Qualitative research practices. Additionally, we are interested in responses from both those who already use open research practices, and those that do not. Usual time to complete the survey is under 20 minutes. 



The practices are defined as those in the FORRT Community-Sourced Glossary of Open Scholarship Terms. We chose this standard due to differences in how some terms are used across disciplines. The survey focuses on 14 core topics in the research lifecycle. Definitions for each of these topics are also informed by the FORRT glossary.



The insights of the survey will be shared on an institutional level and as an aggregated UKRN-wide report. Data is collected anonymously. You have the chance to enter a prize draw to win one of ten (per institution) Â£50.00 Amazon vouchers (we will collect personal information should you decide to take part in the prize draw. This data is not linked to your survey responses to safeguard your anonymity).



Survey responses will inform the implementation of open research practices and training at UKRN institutions. Therefore, it is important for all views to be represented. You are encouraged to take part whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research. Your participation will ensure that related guidance developed at departmental/institutional and/or UKRN-wide level is appropriate for your discipline. 



The survey was approved by the University of Manchester Ethics Review Panel (Ref: 2022-15389-26232) and the Participant Information Sheet can be found by clicking on this link.

The counter-argument to this is that the knowledge produced is also biased, for example by being normative and/or ableist. This is cultural as this is how it has been (and might still be) taught: I was very much taught this positivist view in my own BSc.

So there is scope for fees support to be more inclusive, with more nuance and more attention to all the different levels of underrepresentation. At institutional level, where HEIs have OA fees agreements, it can add paperwork, so I would also argue for more systematic agreements.

One of the many challenges they face is language barrier, which is in itself an ethical concern that foster bias, at times colonial reproduction (not just north-south but also south-south). Another challenge is the length of the field work and the usage of gatekeepers who are one-sided or representative a small portion of society and the context of research - this in in turn creates power relations that often cause more problems than they contribute to creating ""social impact"", which is what academic research claims to advertise. Researchers then use this in return for seeking more grants and building a PR image. Another common problem especially in settings where the leading researcher is unfamiliar with the context of research is outsourcing. When research is outsourced to less senior yet more informed persons, a lot of issues arise: abuse of the main researcher's power, poor research, and exploitation (of both the subjects of research but also of the leading field researchers).

Open access publications are ubiquitous.  Open access to processed results has become so over the last decade or so.  Open access to raw data is, in my opinion, not realistically possible.

This is not practicable.
